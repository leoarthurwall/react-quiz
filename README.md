# THE GREAT QUIZ APP

In this project I build a simple quis using React js. Try answering the 10 set questions and see what score you get at the end.

The questions, answers and their respective numbers will display dynamically.

Once you get to the end of the quiz, you'll be able to view your previous score and retry the quiz to try and beat it.

Good luck!
